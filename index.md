# Welcome to Galaxy-P Metaproteomics Website

The impact of microbiome on human health and the environment is receiving increased attention. Characterizing proteins expressed by a complex microbiome and interpreting their functional signature requires sophisticated informatics tools and workflows tailored to metaproteomics. Galaxy-P offers an open source, web-based bioinformatics platform for disseminating metaproteomics software and workflows.  Within this platform, an easily accessible and documented metaproteomic software tools and workflows are aimed at training researchers in their operation and using the tools for more widespread use. The modular workflows encompass the core requirements of metaproteomic informatics: a) database generation, b) peptide spectral matching, c) taxonomic analysis and d) functional analysis.
